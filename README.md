# CASE-STUDY-1
# CASE STUDY: HOW DOES A BIKE-SHARE NAVIGATE SPEEDY SUCCESS?

# ASK
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. To do that this case study aims to answer

# Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1.
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

For the first part of this case study the analysis will focus on the first question;
1.
## How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# PREPARE

For this case study,I used the Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data using the link in the pdf. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.) This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

# PROCESS
For this analysis I use R as my first tool for data cleaning and data analysis. I load the data from CSV file, combine it and conduct data cleaning. I check for consistency in my data formats and that the variables I have can answer my questions.

# ANALYZE
For the analysis I did a descriptive statistics and drew bar graphs to show avarage ride lenght, number of rides by weekday and filtered by member and casual.

# ACT 
 For further analysis I exported the cleaned csv data and uploaded on tablue to create a more interactive visual to share with stakeholders.
